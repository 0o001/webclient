This will protect your files even if your iPhone falls into the wrong hands. There is also an option to erase all data and logout if the wrong password is entered over 10 times.\n\nVarious bug fixes and speed improvements.\n\nYour feedback is very important to us and, although we might not answer every email, we read each and every one.\n\nAlso, your 5-stars rating in the AppStore is always appreciated.",
