These will be rewritten as %xx on the local side and converted back to the original character when synced back. The Windows Explorer also has trouble with a number of seemingly innocuous file and folder names - \"con.doc\", for example, would not be accessible (to understand why, you have to be a geek or a veteran, or both). If you encounter such a situation, simply rename the file on the cloud side. Foreign characters in filenames are fully supported.\r\n\r\nMEGAsync supports fairly deep folder structures (MEGA itself is limited to a maximum of 63 levels) and very long pathnames (up to 32,000 characters under Windows).
