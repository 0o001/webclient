MEGA is fully accessible without prior software installs and remains the only cloud storage provider with browser-based high-performance end-to-end encryption. The only visible signs of the crypto layer operating under MEGA\u2019s hood are the entropy collection during signup, the lack of a password reset feature and the novel (and browser-specific) ways file transfers are conducted. Today, millions of business and personal users rely on MEGA to securely and reliably store and serve petabytes of data and we believe that this success is the result of MEGA\u2019s low barrier to entry to a more secure cloud.",

We are aware that some agencies submit incorrect takedown notices from time to time, but we are unable to find such errors in advance.",
    "8774": "You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice. You should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.",

If MEGA does not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or such communication that it does receive does not in MEGA\u2019s sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, MEGA may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 business days provided it has no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.",
