Edward Snowden's revelations 137 days later fundamentally changed public attitudes and it became excruciatingly clear that <i>security by policy<\/i> (\"we have access to your data, but we promise to keep it confidential and not misuse it\") had not been good enough. Anything short of <i>security by design<\/i> (\"we cannot gain access to your data without you being able to find out\"), for which strong end-to-end encryption is an essential prerequisite, now seems grossly insufficient.",

MEGA is fully accessible without prior software installs and remains the only cloud storage provider with browser-based high-performance end-to-end encryption. The only visible signs of the crypto layer operating under MEGA's hood are the entropy collection during signup, the lack of a password reset feature and the novel (and browser-specific) ways file transfers are conducted. Today, millions of business and personal users rely on MEGA to securely and reliably store and serve petabytes of data and we believe that this success is the result of MEGA's low barrier to entry to a more secure cloud.",
