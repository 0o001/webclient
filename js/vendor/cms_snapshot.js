Mega will periodically publish statistics on its compliance activities to provide public confidence that the service it provides is lawful and legitimate and is operated in a manner that protects the rights of users.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\"><strong>Regulatory Background<\/strong><\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">Mega was designed, and is operated, to ensure that it achieves the highest levels of compliance with regulatory requirements.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">Mega&rsquo;s service is governed by New Zealand law and users submit exclusively to New Zealand arbitral dispute resolution. Mega has sought extensive legal advice on its service by lawyers in New Zealand and various other jurisdictions, including the United States, to minimise the risk of non-compliance with regulatory requirements in the main jurisdictions in which it operates.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">Mega maintains market leading processes for dealing with users who upload and share copyright infringing material or breach any other legal requirements. Mega cannot view or determine the contents of files stored in the Mega system as files are encrypted by users before the files reach Mega. However, if a user voluntarily shares a link to a file they have stored (with its decryption key), then anyone with that link can decrypt and view the file contents. Mega&rsquo;s terms of service provide that copyright holders who become aware of public links to their copyright material can contact Mega to have the offending files removed from Mega&rsquo;s system.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">The USA Digital Millennium Copyright Act (<strong>DMCA<\/strong>) process, the European Union Directive 2000\/31\/EC and New Zealand&rsquo;s Copyright Act process provide Mega with a safe harbour, shielding Mega from liability for the material that its users upload and share using Mega&rsquo;s services. Mega complies with the conditions on which that safe harbour is made available by allowing any person to submit a notice that their copyright material is being incorrectly shared through the Mega service. When Mega receives such notices it promptly removes or disables access to the offending file or files, depending on the type of request, consistent with the Terms of Service agreed to by every registered user. The number of files which have been subject to such take down notices continues to be very small, indicative of a user base which appreciates the speed and flexibility of Mega&rsquo;s system for fully legal business and personal use.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">The DMCA requires links to be taken down expeditiously. Most cloud providers target takedown within 24 hours. Mega targets takedown within a maximum of 4 hours, with takedowns frequently being actioned much quicker than the 4 hour target.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">In implementing its takedown notice policy and processes, Mega initiated discussions with New Zealand law enforcement authorities. Mega has adopted policies and processes which it has been advised are consistent with their requirements<span class=\"s2\"><sup><\/sup><\/span>.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">Mega has very clear Terms of Service that have to be acknowledged by every new user before their account activation can be completed. Those terms make it very clear (e.g. in clauses 17 and 19) that Mega won&rsquo;t allow infringement or any other illegal activity.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">However it is logistically impossible for any cloud storage service (or indeed any other service provider in the internet chain, such as the computer supplier, ISP, browser supplier etc) to review all uploaded content due to the number of files that are uploaded each second. Mega&rsquo;s current rate is 15-20 million files per day or more than 200 per second. The infeasibility of checking uploads has been recognised in numerous court cases, even prior to enactment of the DMCA.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">Even if content could be reviewed, it is not possible to determine whether it is infringing or not. Many copyrighted materials provide the user with a licence to make a backup copy. Recently enacted UK law confirms this right. Uploading it to a cloud storage service is not infringing.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">Thus other similar cloud storage services don&rsquo;t make any positive (but almost certainly futile) attempt to assess the copyright status of uploaded materials.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\"><strong>Requests for Removal of Content<\/strong><\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">Mega accepts takedown notices via a dedicated web page<span class=\"s2\"><sup><\/sup><\/span> or by email to <a href=\"mailto:copyright@mega.co.nz\"><span class=\"s3\">copyright@mega.co.nz<\/span><\/a><\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">Requests are processed within a few hours without reviewing their validity<span class=\"s2\"><sup><\/sup><\/span>.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">The submitter is able to choose<\/p><ol><li><i>Disable one link per file - the file will remain in the user's account;<\/i><\/li><li><i>Disable multiple URLs per file - the file will remain in the user's account;<\/i><\/li><li><i>Remove all underlying files of the supplied URL(s) - there is no user permitted to store this under any circumstance worldwide.<\/i><\/li><\/ol><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">Mega receives counter-notices from some users who dispute the validity of the takedown. These counter-notices are processed consistent with the DMCA provisions. Our experience is that most of the counter-notices are genuine and appropriate, due to content owners and agents trawling the internet using robots which generate incorrect notices on behalf of copyright owners.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">Many of the takedown notices are duplicates, i.e. refer to files which have already been removed from the Mega system or are invalid. In Q4 2014 63% of the notices were duplicates\/invalid.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">The number of unique takedown requests submitted to Mega represents a very small and declining percentage of the total number of files stored on Mega. In Q1 2015, the files taken down represented 0.002% of the 5 Billion files stored on Mega servers.<\/p><table style=\"width: 80%; margin-left:10%\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><\/td><td><strong>Files <\/strong><br><strong>Taken Down<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Duplicate or <\/strong><br><strong>Invalid&nbsp;<\/strong><strong style=\"line-height: 1.428571429; background-color: transparent;\">Requests<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Total <\/strong><br><strong>Requests<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>% Duplicated <\/strong><br><strong>Requests<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>TD Files \/ Total Files<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013 Q1      <\/td><td>30,078       <\/td><td>21,779       <\/td><td>51,857       <\/td><td>42%      <\/td><td>0.019%       <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013 Q2       <\/td><td>41,926       <\/td><td>11,846       <\/td><td>53,772       <\/td><td>22%      <\/td><td>0.015%       <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013 Q3       <\/td><td>59,609       <\/td><td>31,884       <\/td><td>91,493       <\/td><td>35%      <\/td><td>0.014%       <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013 Q4       <\/td><td>84,951       <\/td><td>32,595       <\/td><td>117,546      <\/td><td>28%      <\/td><td>0.013%       <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014 Q1       <\/td><td>66,806       <\/td><td>24,300       <\/td><td>91,106       <\/td><td>27%      <\/td><td>0.006%       <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014 Q2       <\/td><td>74,384       <\/td><td>28,414       <\/td><td>102,798      <\/td><td>28%      <\/td><td>0.004%       <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014 Q3       <\/td><td>69,706       <\/td><td>41,514       <\/td><td>111,220      <\/td><td>37%      <\/td><td>0.003%       <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014 Q4       <\/td><td>151,756      <\/td><td>253,209      <\/td><td>404,965      <\/td><td>63%      <\/td><td>0.004%       <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015 Q1       <\/td><td>107,146      <\/td><td>27,836       <\/td><td>134,982      <\/td><td>21%      <\/td><td>0.002%       <\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\"><\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">It should be noted that within these takedown statistics, there are a sizable number of incorrect takedown notices so not all of these takedowns are for infringing material.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\" style=\"text-align:center\"><img src='\/\/cms.mega.nz\/unsigned\/c4af2de8f48f95434f3e8946e4e1f076e45a22f6b9a02ed4a5565637d71a39f8' xsrc='i:c4af2de8f48f95434f3e8946e4e1f076e45a22f6b9a02ed4a5565637d71a39f8'><\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Figure 1       Requests for file takedowns show a rapidly declining trend<\/span><\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\"><strong>Repeat Infringers<\/strong><\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">Mega suspends the account of any user with 5 takedown actions.

We are now taking legal advice on this serious attack against Mega.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">&ldquo;Olswang&rsquo;s credentials on anti-piracy issues are impeccable, and their conclusions totally refute the allegations made in the NetNames report\", said Graham Gaylard, Chief Executive of Mega Limited.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">Mr Gaylard said that Mega was very concerned that the NetNames report had been used by United States Senator Patrick Leahy to apply pressure to major payment providers and credit card companies to withdraw their services from those identified in the report.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">&nbsp;&ldquo;Mega continues to grow rapidly as users appreciate the privacy provided by its User Controlled Encryption, together with the technical aspects of its web and mobile apps. Our users can have absolute confidence that Mega has been designed and continues to operate within the law and in compliance with all regulatory requirements. &nbsp;We operate an efficient and fully compliant takedown process and we have very low levels of infringing content,&rdquo; said Mr Gaylard.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mega.nz\/Mega_Limited_Olswang_Report_15May2015.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/mega.nz\/Mega_Limited_Olswang_Report_15May2015.pdf<\/a><\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mega.nz\/Mega_Limited_Press_Release_re_Olswang_Report_15May2015.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/mega.nz\/Mega_Limited_Press_Release_re_Olswang_Report_15May2015.pdf<\/a><\/p>","t":1431648902,"attaches":{"bimg":"3ac81682f0bb6b295843a7bb77f03f7f89ca650cf6fe2363763efcb39c3ac650","simg":"980ed10ae69601dcca26562dbb46dbed40fadbb63a6c26ca3f4509f1293d3278"}},"post_32":{"id":32,"by":null,"h":"MEGAchat: Technical Security Primer","introtxt":"All content transferred via the MEGA platform is end-to-end encrypted. This means that the end user is the only one who can encrypt or decrypt the content.  It is virtually impossible for MEGA or any network snooper to gain insight of encrypted user ","c":"<p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">All content transferred via the MEGA platform is end-to-end encrypted. This means that the end user is the only one who can encrypt or decrypt the content. It is virtually impossible for MEGA or any network snooper to gain insight of encrypted user stored or transferred content. MEGA users will never have to trust any network providers, or even MEGA as a cloud service provider, to not compromise their privacy. &nbsp;Obviously, this only works if the user can actually trust the cryptographic design as well as the code implementing it.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">The most important way to gain this trust is to release the source to our code, so that anybody can review it and see that we are doing the important technical things that we say we are. We have already released the source code to the MEGA SDK and offer a bug bounty so if there are architecture issues or implementation bugs we can be alerted and can fix them immediately. The MEGA web client source code is also available by using the browser's development tools.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">We can also help build this trust by being open and transparent about the technologies and approaches MEGA is using, which is the primary purpose behind this blog post.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">Let's begin by having a look at the cryptographic design for MEGA. To start with the basics, every user has two key pairs for public key cryptography, a 2048 bit RSA key pair for encryption and an Ed25519 key pair for signing. &nbsp;Public-key cryptography is a class of cryptographic algorithms which requires two separate (but related) keys, one of which is private and one of which is public. &nbsp;Operations with one key (e.g. encryption with public key, signing with private key) are complemented with operations of the other (e.g. decryption with private key, signature verification with the public key). &nbsp;The private keys are stored in the MEGA cloud, protected (encrypted) with the user's master key, which itself is stored with MEGA after being protected through encryption with a key derived from the user's password. Because MEGA only ever knows the public keys, all encryption is controlled by the user, and we recommend a very strong password.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">The RSA public key is signed with the Ed25519 key, so users can verify the RSA key's authenticity. &nbsp;The Ed25519 public key is used to derive a fingerprint (160 bit slice of SHA-256 hash), which is also shown on the user interface as \"authenticity credentials\" to be verified between users. &nbsp;If not verified, the MEGA client still tracks seen fingerprints of all Ed25519 and RSA public keys to alert the user on unexpected changes, e.g. by impostors or snoopers.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">Our latest product, MEGAchat, allows users to make end-to-end encrypted audio and video calls. The audio\/video chat itself is using a new browser-based technology called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.webrtc.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">WebRTC<\/a>, which establishes, where possible, a direct connection between the two peers (peer-to-peer). In some cases (e. g. if somebody is behind a firewall or \"shielded\" through <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Network_address_translation\" target=\"_blank\">NAT<\/a>), the help of a <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT\" target=\"_blank\">TURN\/STUN<\/a> server is involved to facilitate the connection. &nbsp;To set up the environment for WebRTC connections, an <a href=\"http:\/\/xmpp.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">XMPP<\/a> infrastructure is used for presence notifications and connection establishment (\"signalling\" through <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jingle_%28protocol%29\" target=\"_blank\">XMPP\/Jingle<\/a>). &nbsp;This \"signalling\" then hands over further interactions to the WebRTC end-points living in the two connected browsers.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">All connections of the client to the server via XMPP are running through an HTTPS connection. &nbsp;No voice\/video communication is routed through XMPP, only the initial call setup. &nbsp;This includes a three-way hand-shake between the two parties, exchanging the RSA encrypted fingerprints of the WebRTC container's internal certificates, thus effectively avoiding any man-in-the-middle attacks on the WebRTC connection. &nbsp;The WebRTC containers themselves then establish all further session parameters (including encryption) by using the standardised and mandatory <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Datagram_Transport_Layer_Security\" target=\"_blank\">DTLS<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Secure_Real-time_Transport_Protocol\" target=\"_blank\">SRTP<\/a> protocols. &nbsp;SRTP uses AES-128 encryption in a stream cipher mode for all content.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">If everything is done properly, and none of the users' systems are compromised, all data on the established chat connection will be fully confidential. &nbsp;So, the implementation itself must be trustworthy and the consistent delivery of the code must be ensured. &nbsp;All JavaScript code running in the browser is unobfuscated and very easy to inspect for any experienced and technically minded person in this field. &nbsp;The implementation can be reviewed and audited. To avoid any alterations of the served code, initially a secureboot.js file is served to the client. &nbsp;When this file executes, it dynamically retrieves all further JavaScript code and resources into the client, while checking the hash values of all retrieved files. &nbsp;The correct hash values are loaded into secureboot.js at site deployment time. &nbsp;For this reason, we are taking extreme care that secureboot.js is only served from a particularly strongly protected web server, whereas all other code is loaded through a content delivery network (CDN). Updated browser extensions for MEGAchat will be released after the beta, which will further improve security.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">So, what is the outlook for MEGAchat in the future and what are the security assurances to be expected? &nbsp;Well, so far only audio\/video calls via WebRTC are possible. &nbsp;We are not satisfied with that as &nbsp;there is a definite need for text-based communication. &nbsp;In the next release, MEGAchat will be extended to include a text chat feature. &nbsp;Covering the case of privacy with more than two end points is not easy, which is the reason we are still working on it: to get it right! &nbsp;At the launch of the text chat feature, MEGA is planning on publishing one or more white papers, outlining the precise key agreement algorithms with all their properties, thus allowing a proper review of the security properties.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">Note: If you are a security researcher, we may be interested in sharing this material already with you before the release. Please contact MEGA at <a href=\"mailto:crypto@mega.co.nz\">crypto@mega.co.nz<\/a>.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">Users are expecting to be able to use MEGAchat not just with their browsers, but also with one or more mobile or native applications (and see the same view on the conversation from all devices) and we are working hard on native desktop and mobile applications.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">Just as the other MEGA mobile and desktop applications are based on the publicly available <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/meganz\/sdk\" target=\"_blank\">MEGA SDK<\/a> (C++), in the future there will be a companion MEGAchat SDK (C++) to enable third party development.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">We hope that this article helps to increase the understanding behind MEGA's open encryption protocols. MEGA is working hard to ensure we stand up to our company motto \"The Privacy Company\".<\/p><div><br><\/div>","t":1422336905,"attaches":{"simg":"de6521f6e5646dc6d141ce5e1a00f60ae94d817be638cc90fb0f5a846ff82bbc","bimg":"3490e2236c8c6972d018917ed804a4196fb9dd564513dceb85ec7fcf243c6f47"}},"post_31":{"id":31,"by":null,"h":"MEGA 2.0 beta for Android and SDK update","introtxt":"Launched 18 months ago, our Android app has put encrypted cloud storage into the hands of millions of security-conscious users.

Please note that even though all transfers of files from or to your own account originate or terminate in New Zealand, API requests still have to travel all the way to Europe and back, and that your metadata continues to be stored there. Also, our geographic data redundancy policy applies, so all data that is stored on our New Zealand cluster will eventually get mirrored to Europe. Bear this in mind if you are from NZ and legally barred from storing sensitive data offshore.<\/p><p class=\"strong-paragraph\">SDK updated<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">Based on community feedback, our <a href=\"\/#dev\">C++ SDK<\/a> has evolved significantly. We are now working on broad platform support.<\/p><p class=\"strong-paragraph\">Security scare<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">We would like to thank a high-profile member of the MEGA community for highlighting two of the potential security risks associated with using computers in general and JavaScript-based cryptography in particular. All of these issues have been <a href=\"\/#help_security\">covered in our FAQ<\/a> from the start, but we would like to use the opportunity and reiterate them here in case you have missed that:<\/p><p class=\"strong-paragraph\">1. If you have access to a computer, you can break MEGA (and everything else, too)<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">This problem is illustrated by a <a href=\"http:\/\/nzkoz.github.io\/MegaPWN\/\" target=\"_new\">MEGA-specific browser bookmarklet<\/a> that allows the victim to break into his or her own MEGA account. A more generalized approach is outlined in Brian Kaplan's paper <a href=\"http:\/\/cryptome.org\/0003\/RAMisKey.pdf\" target=\"_new\">RAM is Key - Extracting Disk Encryption Keys From Volatile Memory<\/a>. And, needless to say, if the victim installs remote monitoring software (such as a keylogger\/screen grabber) on his machine, the potential security breach becomes pretty much all-encompassing.<\/p><p class=\"strong-paragraph\">2. JavaScript cryptography is weak, because the code is loaded on the fly<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">There are two trust issues associated with on-the-fly code loading: How secure is the delivery mechanism? And will the service provider send me trojaned code upon receipt of e.g. a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/National_security_letter\" target=\"_new\">National Security Letter<\/a>?<\/p><p class=\"strong-paragraph\">2.1 JavaScript delivery<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">The integrity of our JavaScript code depends on the integrity of all SSL certificate issuers that your browser trusts, plus the ISPs between you and our root server cluster and\/or the DNS servers involved. Or, put bluntly, \"if you can break SSL, you can break MEGA\". Of course, if you can break SSL, there might be more interesting targets for you to break than MEGA...<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">In addition, we are continuously monitoring our root and API server SSL certificates from a variety of points around the globe. Should any breach be detected, we will immediately shut down MEGA and only resume service once the situation is clarified.<\/p><p class=\"strong-paragraph\">2.2 Intentional delivery of backdoored JavaScript code by us to specific users<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">Technically, we could serve you backdoored JavaScript code that sends your master encryption key back to us. But that would be pointless, because any such attempt could easily be detected and would completely ruin our credibility. Some juristictions force service providers to install backdoors, but MEGA will <strong>always<\/strong> migrate to a jurisdiction that respects your right to privacy instead of putting your data at risk. Major software vendors, e.g. in the United States, could easily be forced by their local government to abuse their update mechanisms to deliver backdoor code to specific targets. We will never provide any government with any backdoors, period.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">The fundamental difference between traditional (server-side encrypting) and secure (client-side end-to-end encrypting) cloud storage providers is that the former can intercept all data of all users without the victims having a way of finding out, while the latter have to do something that is detectable on the client side.<\/p><p class=\"strong-paragraph\">2.3 Solutions<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">If you are worried about the risks outlined above, you should use MEGA in a way that does not rely on code delivered on the fly.<\/p><p class=\"strong-paragraph\">2.3.1 Loading MEGA's JavaScript code base from your local machine<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">We offer a browser extension (currently <a href=\"\/#chrome\">available for Chrome<\/a>, coming soon for Firefox) that holds all of MEGA's code locally. If you install a version that someone you trust has code-audited and turn off automatic updates, we cannot backdoor you even if we wanted to.<\/p><p class=\"strong-paragraph\">2.3.2 Using a client application<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">In a similar vein, non-autoupdating client applications that were written or audited by someone you trust are immune against dynamic backdooring.<\/p><p class=\"strong-paragraph\">3. Untrusted JavaScript loaded from a website is still safer than an untrusted executable loaded from the same website<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">It is a common misperception that JavaScript is inherently insecure and that native machine code is a much better choice for cryptography. While it is true that full access to the host machine's features allows for some additional degree of security (such as preventing keys from being sent to swap space), malicious JavaScript executing in your browser's sandbox (assuming, of course, that no known browser vulnerabilities exist &mdash; an admittedly rather weak assumption) at least cannot take over your entire user account or, if you work as root\/Administrator, system!<\/p>","t":1378151280,"attaches":{"simg":"577b198422eb13cd4e69a3d010bdf29c88be1539f807b64f84731a8a1d1132dc","bimg":"5872cdf99ebff516c616fedc78b1dd2026188bb21e417bb7aabbdfca2f58676c","15677eb1d0ad4a":"577b198422eb13cd4e69a3d010bdf29c88be1539f807b64f84731a8a1d1132dc","15677eb1d0ae00":"5872cdf99ebff516c616fedc78b1dd2026188bb21e417bb7aabbdfca2f58676c"}},"post_20":{"id":20,"by":null,"h":"New Guidance Published","introtxt":"MEGA has today published its Guidance on Requesting User Information or \"Takedown\" of User Data which comes into force","c":"<p>MEGA has today published its <a href=\"#takedown\">Guidance on Requesting User Information or \"Takedown\" of User Data<\/a> which comes into force from 23 August 2013.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">The Guidance describes how MEGA will look to achieve the balance between maintaining industry-leading levels of confidentiality of user information and data with the lawful constraints on privacy.

However, you still have to trust three entities when you load <a href=\"https:\/\/mega.co.nz\/\">https:\/\/mega.co.nz\/<\/a> in your browser: Us, our static root server cluster and all certification authorities that your browser trusts (or all relevant DNS servers and upstream ISPs). Concerned? To eliminate the latter two, we're introducing a <a href=\"#chrome\">Chrome App<\/a> that loads all of MEGA's JavaScript code from your local machine. Updates to the app are cryptographically signed &mdash; by us, not by an entity that falls under the jurisdiction of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/National_security_letter\" target=\"_blank\">National Security Letters<\/a>, which unfortunately precludes offering the app through the Chrome Web Store. The code installed by the app is open to public scrutiny, and if you turn off automatic updates, nobody can sneakily plant a trojaned version on your computer any more &mdash; not even us.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">A similar extension for Mozilla Firefox is currently in the making, which will also feature an enhanced download engine and other improvements.<\/p><p class=\"strong-paragraph\">3. Vulnerability Rewards Update \/ Content Security Policy<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">It has been four months since the last bug bounty was paid (by the way, security holes in our newly released <a href=\"#dev\">MEGA SDK<\/a>'s C++ code qualify &mdash; please have a look).<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">As seven out of the ten vulnerabilities that earned a reward were XSS issues, we have added a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Content_Security_Policy\" target=\"_blank\">content security policy (CSP)<\/a>, making it much more difficult to exploit these successfully. Please use a <a href=\"http:\/\/caniuse.com\/contentsecuritypolicy\" target=\"_blank\">browser with CSP support<\/a>.<\/p>","t":1374272663,"attaches":{"simg":"239818355a11acb2837ab42caf22052b8bec984c1cdd67608c81927708360f6f","15677eb1d095a4":"239818355a11acb2837ab42caf22052b8bec984c1cdd67608c81927708360f6f"}},"post_18":{"id":18,"by":null,"h":"Kia ora, hello from New Zealand.","introtxt":"I am Vikram Kumar, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of MEGA.

Whether you have already signed up to use MEGA or are thinking about it, you are the reason why MEGA exists.<br><br>MEGA's rapid growth in the five months since launch is an indicator of your overwhelming support.<\/p><div class=\"clear\"><\/div><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">To cater to the massive demand for storage and bandwidth, MEGA has deployed additional storage nodes in Luxembourg and New Zealand. The latter will also improve latency for MEGA users in Australia, Pacific Islands, and USA West Coast.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">We don't take your support lightly. The MEGA team is committed to keeping the service as quick, easy to use, and uncluttered as possible. We appreciate that you want a reliable service, one that you can trust. As a small gesture of thanks, MEGA is not enforcing the free 50 GB storage limit at present (but, yes, we will need to enforce that at some point in the future so getting a Pro account is a good idea).<\/p><p class=\"strong-paragraph\">Apps and desktop client<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">You have been telling us for a while now that apps (Android, iOS) as well as a desktop synchronisation client are very valuable. The MEGA team have been busy working on these, including working with others to build these as quickly as possible.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">A foundation requirement for these efforts has been the development of a Software Development Kit (SDK). The SDK makes it much easier and more secure for developers to use MEGA for their own apps and services. The apps and desktop synchronisation clients also use the SDK. Getting it right has therefore been of critical importance. It is also an extremely complex undertaking. This is why it has taken longer than we expected.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">The good news is that the <a href=\"#dev\">beta version of the SDK<\/a> is done. We've also launched an <a href=\"#affiliates\">Affiliate Program<\/a> to partner with interested people and organisations in driving and jointly benefitting from innovative services using MEGA as a platform. The official <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.flyingottersoftware.mega\" target=\"_blank\">Android app<\/a> has also been a big hit.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">All of this should give you confidence that remaining apps and desktop synchronisation clients are moving ahead as well.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">You have also asked for messaging (email, chat, etc.) from MEGA with all the benefits of end-to-end encryption. We are working on this too.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">All of these service development efforts require the best software engineers in the world. MEGA is looking for lead developers (details at <a href=\"#blog_14\">mega.co.nz\/#blog_14<\/a>) to help deliver on your expectations from us.<\/p><p class=\"strong-paragraph\">Your comments, questions<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">I will periodically use this blog to keep you updated with happenings at MEGA and to better explain MEGA's progress of being the world's Privacy Company.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">In the meantime, you can always email me your comments and questions at <a href=\"mailto:ceo@mega.co.nz\">ceo@mega.co.nz<\/a>.

This describes how MEGA will generally act to protect the privacy of the users of its services within the legal framework in which it operates.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">Please send your feedback by email to <a href=\"mailto:ceo@mega.co.nz\">ceo@mega.co.nz<\/a>. Your comments will help to ensure that MEGA gets it right. The policy finally adopted will be published on MEGA's website in due course.<\/p><p class=\"strong-paragraph\">Why a policy is required<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">MEGA strives for transparency of intentions and consistency of actions. People put their trust in MEGA and it is important for expectations to be well informed.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">Recently, there have been rolling revelations of how governments around the world are spying on Internet activities. In the name of national security and protecting economic interests, governments are secretly collecting and storing everything people do online. While further revelations will illuminate the full extent of ubiquitous surveillance globally, there is no doubt that protecting privacy online needs routine encryption.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">These revelations have raised questions of how popular, leading online services headquartered in USA cooperate (or are forced to cooperate) with governments. Much of this is speculation as the relationship and practices are kept secret by the law and gag orders.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">MEGA is subject to New Zealand jurisdiction and law. Within the applicable legal framework, there is some latitude for organisations to make choices of the extent and nature of cooperating with law enforcement and other authorities. MEGA, as The Privacy Company, intends to act so as to maximise privacy protection to the extent possible and appropriate within the applicable laws.<\/p><p class=\"strong-paragraph\">Lawful use of MEGA's services<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">Cloud storage and collaboration services are still in their infancy. People and businesses are constantly finding new and innovative ways to use and benefit from such services. MEGA encourages and supports the widest range of lawful use of its services.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">MEGA was designed and operates with this in mind. As an example, MEGA was architected to protect privacy rather than enable anonymity.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">The reality is that MEGA's services are overwhelmingly used for lawful purposes. For example, MEGA receives 50-100 takedown notices daily for alleged copyright infringement. It has received just one warrant from law enforcement authorities for taking down stored material since launch.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">For context, Google gets over half a million copyright removal notices each day according to its <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/transparencyreport\/removals\/copyright\/\" target=\"_blank\">Transparency Report<\/a>. Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/transparency.twitter.com\/copyright-notices\" target=\"_blank\">reports<\/a> getting 3,268 notices for the second half of 2012. From another perspective, Microsoft has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/about\/corporatecitizenship\/en-us\/reporting\/transparency\/\" target=\"_blank\">reported<\/a> getting 75,378 law enforcement requests in 2012 while Facebook <a href=\"http:\/\/newsroom.fb.com\/News\/636\/Facebook-Releases-Data-Including-All-National-Security-Requests\" target=\"_blank\">reports<\/a> getting between 9,000 and 10,000 requests for user data from government entities in the second half of 2012.<\/p><p class=\"strong-paragraph\">Your views<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">Developing the draft Law Enforcement and Takedown Requests Policy has been a complex undertaking as it requires taking into account and balancing numerous legal, business and technical perspectives. Your comments and views are invaluable in helping MEGA getting the final, adopted policy right. Thank you for taking the time and effort to do so. Please note that the draft policy is not a standalone document. It needs to be looked at in the context of the <a href=\"#terms\">Terms of Service<\/a>, <a href=\"#privacy\">Privacy Policy<\/a>, <a href=\"#copyright\">Copyright<\/a> terms, and applicable laws.<\/p><p class=\"strong-paragraph\">Draft Law Enforcement and Takedown Requests Policy<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">(You can also download the draft policy as a <a href=\"https:\/\/eu.static.mega.co.nz\/Law_Enforcement_and_Takedown_Requests_draft.pdf\">PDF document<\/a>)<\/p><p class=\"strong-paragraph\">Overview<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">MEGA is 'The Privacy Company' and values the privacy of the users of its services. The company is committed to ensuring the highest level of security and confidentiality of data that users entrust to it. However, privacy is not an absolute right and is subject to lawful limitations.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">This policy describes how MEGA will generally act to achieve that balance and, in particular, the approach it will take to requests in criminal and civil actions against or involving its users. The policy is aimed at providing transparency to everyone interested in MEGA's services and consistency in actions.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">THIS POLICY IS PROVIDED FOR ASSISTANCE AND GUIDANCE ONLY. IT DOES NOT CREATE ANY LEGALLY BINDING OBLIGATIONS ON THE PART OF MEGA AND MEGA BEARS NO LIABILITY WHATSOEVER FOR COMPLYING OR NOT COMPLYING WITH IT, AS IT SEES FIT, AT ANY TIME. ALL LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS OF LIABILITY SET OUT IN MEGA'S <a href=\"#terms\">TERMS OF SERVICE<\/a> APPLY EQUALLY TO THIS POLICY.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">MEGA reserves the right, unless required otherwise by applicable law, to provide differing levels and categories of information in response to different requests. Persons making a request should first check with MEGA what information will be available, particularly before applying for a production order under the General Policy below.<\/p><p class=\"strong-paragraph\">Principles<\/p><ul class=\"ul-small-pad\"><li>The fundamental privacy-protective design of MEGA's services underlies MEGA's approach to law enforcement and takedown requests. This includes user control over the encryption\/decryption keys as well as the extent and manner to which their files\/folders are shared.<\/li><li>This policy will be publicly available, including publication on MEGA's website. MEGA may also periodically publish a summary of requests received and actions taken under this policy.<\/li><li>Separate policy provisions will apply to emergency response, child exploitation material, and allegations of copyright or other intellectual property infringement. These are dealt with separately below.<\/li><li>Even if the decryption key is provided to staff or otherwise publicly available, MEGA generally will not view, or attempt to view, files against which action is requested but it reserves the right to do so where the file has been decrypted if it considers necessary or appropriate. MEGA is not obliged to take action unless required to do so by applicable law but any action will be undertaken objectively, based only on the information provided by third parties, this policy, its <a href=\"#terms\">terms of service<\/a> and its <a href=\"#privacy\">privacy policy<\/a>. Where there is any inconsistency between those documents, the terms of service prevail.<\/li><li>MEGA will promptly inform the user of any action taken where possible provided it considers it appropriate or is required to do so by applicable law.<\/li><li>MEGA may amend, replace or withdraw this policy temporarily or permanently from time to time as it sees fit. MEGA will generally endeavour to give advance notice if possible, before changes to this policy come into effect.<\/li><li>Applicable law under this policy is New Zealand law. However, MEGA may, if it chooses to do so, without being obliged to do so, and without submitting itself to any other jurisdiction's law or courts or tribunals, accept requests made by and assist non-New Zealand law enforcement authorities and civil claimants in whole or in part. It may decline to do so for any reason or no reason while being guided by the Principles detailed above and the trust reposed in MEGA by its users.<\/li><\/ul><p class=\"strong-paragraph\">General Policy<\/p><ul class=\"ul-small-pad\"><li>The provisions in this section apply to all law enforcement and takedown requests other than those for Emergency Response, alleged Child Exploitation Material, alleged Copyright Infringing Material or alleged Other Intellectual Property Infringing Material (for which, see below).<\/li><li>MEGA will generally only take action when <strong>required<\/strong> to do so by applicable law or a Court or law enforcement authority with appropriate jurisdiction. Generally, this means a 'production order' as per Subpart 2 of Part 3 of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.legislation.govt.nz\/act\/public\/2012\/0024\/latest\/DLM2136536.html\" target=\"_blank\">Search and Surveillance Act 2012<\/a> is required rather than simply a formal or informal request for information and\/or action.<\/li><li>The information to be provided or action to be taken by MEGA shall be as specified in the relevant law or order, subject to MEGA being technically able to provide that information or take that action. As noted above, persons making requests via production order should contact MEGA first to see what information may be made available.<\/li><\/ul><p class=\"strong-paragraph\">Emergency Response<\/p><ul class=\"ul-small-pad\"><li>This is defined as a situation where, in the expert judgement of a senior officer of the New Zealand Police or similar law enforcement officer or authority, MEGA is assured that the person making the request has valid reasons to believe, based on reasonable evidence, that disclosure or action is necessary to prevent or lessen an imminent and serious threat (as defined in section 2(1) of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.legislation.govt.nz\/act\/public\/1993\/0028\/latest\/DLM296639.html\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Act 1993<\/a>) to:<ul class=\"ul-small-pad\" style=\"padding-top:10px;\"><li>public health or public safety;<\/li><li>the life or health of an individual or individuals<\/li><\/ul> and where the person giving such assurance confirms that the threat is of such imminence that there is not time to obtain a production order.<\/li><li>If satisfied as to the above, MEGA may in its discretion accept a request in such situations in good faith. In doing so, MEGA will be relying on the assurances given by the person making such request and will look to them and their organisation to cover any costs, damages, penalties, compensation or other liability should that assurance turn out to be incorrect or wrongly given for any reason.<\/li><li>The information to be provided or action to be taken by MEGA shall be as specified by, and agreed with, the appropriately designated officer.<\/li><li>MEGA will provide the New Zealand Police and other agencies approved by MEGA with the mobile phone number and email address of contact person(s) who will act on behalf of MEGA in an emergency response situation.<\/li><\/ul><p class=\"strong-paragraph\">Child Exploitation Material<\/p><ul class=\"ul-small-pad\"><li>MEGA does not condone, authorise, support or knowingly facilitate the storage or sharing of objectionable material as defined in section 3 of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.legislation.govt.nz\/act\/public\/1993\/0094\/latest\/DLM312895.html\" target=\"_blank\">Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993<\/a>. MEGA will act under the General Policy set out above in respect of all objectionable material and reserves the rights set out in its terms of service to take down or disable access to such material as it sees fit.<\/li><li>However, MEGA views child exploitative material as defined in sections 3(1A) and 3(2)(a) of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.legislation.govt.nz\/act\/public\/1993\/0094\/latest\/DLM312895.html\" target=\"_blank\">Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993<\/a> as worthy of special treatment.<\/li><li>Where, in the expert judgement of an Inspector of Publications of the New Zealand Department of Internal Affairs, Censorship Compliance Unit or similar authority acceptable to MEGA, MEGA is assured that the person making a request has valid reasons to believe, based on reasonable evidence, that disclosure is necessary to gather evidence in relation to an active investigation involving child exploitation material, MEGA will take such action and make such disclosures as it may agree in its discretion with the person making such request.<\/li><\/ul><p class=\"strong-paragraph\">Allegations of Copyright Infringement<\/p><ul class=\"ul-small-pad\"><li>Users are warned in MEGA's terms of service and when using the service they must comply with all laws including copyright and other intellectual property laws. This includes, but is not limited to, a warning when generating a link for sharing files\/folders in the File Manager.<\/li><li>MEGA will publish on its website the information to be provided, and statements to be made by copyright owners or their duly authorised agents\/representatives, to notify MEGA of an alleged copyright infringement.<\/li><li>All copyright infringement notices should be made via the <a href=\"#copyrightnotice\">specific form<\/a> published on MEGA's website. All requests by other channels, including email, may be returned to sender with a request to use the online form before they are actioned.<\/li><li>The notice provider of alleged copyright infringement shall be given the option of requesting either removal of link(s) to an allegedly infringing file or removal of all file(s) relating to a specific link\/URL.<\/li><li>MEGA will act on copyright infringement notices in accordance with its <a href=\"#copyright\">copyright infringement policy<\/a>.<\/li><\/ul><p class=\"strong-paragraph\">Other Intellectual Property Infringement<\/p><ul class=\"ul-small-pad\"><li>MEGA will act in response to allegations of other forms of intellectual property infringement (e.g. trade mark infringement) in broadly similar fashion as for copyright infringement, reserving to itself the same discretions, rights and protections.<\/li><li>Notices of alleged intellectual property infringement other than copyright infringement, setting out full details similar to those required for copyright infringement notices, should be sent to <a href=\"mailto:ip@mega.co.nz\">ip@mega.co.nz<\/a>.<\/li><\/ul><p class=\"strong-paragraph\">Exceptions<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">Any action by MEGA contrary to this policy shall only be undertaken with the prior written authorisation of the Chief Executive Officer.<\/p><p class=\"strong-paragraph\">Changes to Policy<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">All changes to this policy shall be notified via a post in MEGA's blog, including the date when the new policy shall come into force (which may be immediately on posting if necessary or appropriate).

Since we set out to improve this rather dissatisfying situation three days ago, some news outlets have made attempts to dismantle our crypto architecture. Frankly, we were not too impressed with the results and would like to address the points that were raised:<\/p><div class=\"blog-new-full-div2\"><\/div><p class=\"strong-paragraph\"> ars technica: <span class=\"red\">\"Megabad: A quick look at the state of Mega's encryption\"<\/span><\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\"><span class=\"italic-quote\"><span class=\"red\">\"<\/span> The key used to encrypt your Mega files and folders is stored on Mega's servers, rather than on your local computer.<span class=\"red\">\"<\/span><\/span><\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">This is correct - the only key that MEGA requires to be stored on the user side is the login password, in the user's brain. This password unlocks the master key, which in turn unlocks the file\/folder\/share\/private keys.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\"><span class=\"italic-quote\"><span class=\"red\">\"<\/span> It is telling that there appears to be no password recovery mechanism anywhere in the Mega or log-on screens, nor any method of changing your password in the user control panel.<span class=\"red\">\"<\/span><\/span>Because the master AES-128 key is encrypted using your password, remembering the password is vital. Losing it means you don't just lose the ability to log on to the service - you lose the ability to decrypt your files, period.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">This is correct (and comes as no surprise) - however, this will change in the near future:<\/p><ul class=\"ul-small-pad\"><li>A password change feature will re-encrypt the master key with your new password and update it on our servers<\/li><li>A password reset mechanism will allow you to log back into your account, with all files being unreadable. Now, if you have any pre-exported file keys, you can import them to regain access to those files. On top of that, you could ask your share peers to send you the share-specific keys, but that's it - the remainder of your data appears as binary garbage until you remember your password.<\/li><\/ul><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\"><span class=\"italic-quote\"><span class=\"red\">\"<\/span> Without adding entropy, the \"random\" primes generated by math.random for use as RSA keys are really only pseudo-random and can be guessed.<span class=\"red\">\"<\/span><\/span>Because the master AES-128 key is encrypted using your password, remembering the password is vital. Losing it means you don't just lose the ability to log on to the service - you lose the ability to decrypt your files, period.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">This is correct - and quite a strange statement to make after conceding that mouse and keyboard entropy are indeed used to enhance Math.random(). We will, however, add a feature that allows the user to add as much entropy manually as he sees fit before proceeding to the key generation.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\"><span class=\"blog-dark\">[On deduplication]<\/span><span class=\"italic-quote\"><span class=\"red\">\"<\/span> Whatever the underlying method, the fact that block deduplication exists is a blow against the \"see no evil\" approach taken by Mega.<span class=\"red\">\"<\/span><\/span><\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\"><strong>Fact #1:<\/strong> Once this feature is activated, chunk MACs will indeed be stored on the server side, but they will of course be encrypted (and we will not use ECB!).<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\"><strong>Fact #2:<\/strong> MEGA indeed uses deduplication, but it does so based on the entire file post-encryption rather than on blocks pre-encryption. If the same file is uploaded twice, encrypted with the same random 128-bit key, only one copy is stored on the server. Or, if (and this is much more likely!) a file is copied between folders or user accounts through the file manager or the API, all copies point to the same physical file.<\/p><div class=\"blog-new-full-div2\"><\/div><p class=\"strong-paragraph\"> Forbes: <span class=\"red\">\"Megabad: A quick look at the state of Mega's encryption\"<\/span><\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\"><span class=\"italic-quote\"><span class=\"red\">\"<\/span> So Mega, or anyone else who gains control of the Mega server sending the crypto algorithms, can turn off that encryption or steal the user's private key, which would allow decryption of all past and future uploads<span class=\"red\">\"<\/span><\/span><\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">Correct.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\"><strong>Fact #1:<\/strong> Our FAQ states exactly that and warns people that do not trust us to refrain from logging into the site (but they could, in theory, still safely use MEGA through client apps from vendors they trust).<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\"><strong>Fact #2:<\/strong> Any software maker offering online application updates is able to plant Trojan code into specific targets' computers, with much more far-reaching consequences.<\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\"><span class=\"italic-quote\"><span class=\"red\">\"<\/span>If you can break SSL, you can break MEGA.<span class=\"red\">\"<\/span><\/span><\/p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">Yes.

While all current browsers are capable of uploading large files, downloading is size-constrained with Internet Explorer, Edge, Firefox and Safari due to their lack of support for HTML5 streaming file writing.

If you have MEGAsync installed, it is used for downloading automatically, and the download folder is configured in the <strong>MEGAsync settings<\/strong>. If you are using Safari, you must manually save each downloaded file. <\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/cms.mega.nz\/unsigned\/05d08b185b7568cc3aba5ba59b52a0dadeef91e5aa8bf75b647c8b6a48d351f9\" alt=\"Image\" \/><\/p>","c":[0]},{"q":" Can I upload the same file multiple times?\r","a":"<p>Because our servers can't decrypt your filenames, collisions have to be dealt with on the client side.

For your convenience, interrupted transfers will resume automatically after a cool-down period or after new traffic quota become available.<\/p>","c":[0]},{"q":" What is the upload speed limiting feature good for?\r","a":"<p>Many routers do not prioritise smaller packets in case of link congestion, resulting in your inbound traffic being severely affected when your outbound link runs full.

Data uploaded is encrypted on the uploading device before it is sent out to the Internet, and data downloaded is decrypted only after it has arrived on the downloading device. The client machines are responsible for generating, exchanging and managing the encryption keys.

Please see our [privacy policy](<a href=\"https:\/\/mega.nz\/\">https:\/\/mega.nz\/<\/a><\/p>","c":[2]},{"q":" Is my stored data absolutely secure?\r","a":"<p>All security is relative. The following attack vectors exist - they are not specific to MEGA, but we want you to know about the risks:<\/p>\n<p>Individual accounts can be jeopardised by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Spyware on your computer. A simple keylogger is enough, but session credentials and keys could also be extracted from memory or the filesystem.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Shoulder surfing. Do not type your password while someone could watch your keystrokes.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Password brute-forcing. Use strong passwords.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>Phishing. Always confirm the security status of your connection (https:\/\/) and the correct domain name (mega.co.nz) before entering your password.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Large-scale attacks could be mounted through:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A &quot;man in the middle&quot; attack. Requires issuing a valid duplicate SSL certificate in combination with DNS forging and\/or attacks on our BGP routes (a DigiNotar-style scenario).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Gaining access to the webservers hosting <a href=\"https:\/\/mega.co.nz\/index.html\">https:\/\/mega.co.nz\/index.html<\/a> and replacing that file with a forged version (this would not affect access through the installed app base). Note that manipulating content on our distributed static content CDN does not pose a security risk, as all active content loaded from index.html is subject to verification with a cryptographic hash (think of it as some kind of &quot;secure boot&quot; for websites). This type of attack requires sending malicious code to the client and is therefore detectable.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>Gaining access to our core server infrastructure and creating forged key requests on existing shares. This type of attack only affects data in accounts with shared folders and is detectable on the client side as well.<\/li>\n<\/ul>","c":[2]},{"q":" What if I don't trust you? Is it still safe for me to use MEGA?\r","a":"<p>If you don't trust us, you cannot run any code provided by us, which precludes opening MEGA in your browser and entering your login credentials. However, due to MEGA's end-to-end encryption paradigm, you can safely use client applications written or audited by someone you trust. <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/meganz\/sdk\">MEGA\u2019s own SDK is available for review at GitHub<\/a>; the JavaScript client code can be inspected by opening the browser\u2019s developer console.<\/p>","c":[2]},{"q":" Is data that I put in shared folders as secure my other data?\r","a":"<p>Shared folders, by their nature, are only as secure as their least secure member. Use the most restrictive level of access that fits your requirements.<\/p>","c":[2]},{"q":" Let's assume that a MEGA storage node is physically compromised. What are the risks?\r","a":"<p>Even if the attacker had the encryption key for a given file on that node, he could still not replace it with a forged one without causing the subsequent downloads to fail. Users would receive a \u201cDecryption error\u201d message after downloading such a manipulated file.<\/p>","c":[2]},{"q":" Is it a good idea to store all of my data in a single place?\r","a":"<p>Always keep redundant copies of important files, online and offline. Although we use multi-level RAID technology, there is no guarantee against loss of data, such as through multiple concurrent failures, unauthorised takedown notices or repeated unprecedented government misconduct.<\/p>","c":[2]},{"q":" Why should I entrust my data to, of all people, you?\r","a":"<p>We provide for user controlled encryption (UCE) where you, the user, control the keys. The UCE implementation is open source, and we invite and encourage the community to scrutinise it and provide feedback. We believe that this approach is much safer than storing your data on a provider with server-side encryption where the service provider controls the keys or, worse, where there is no encryption at all. If any MEGA accounts were suddenly accessible without a password due to a programming error, their file contents would be unreadable, because the account\u2019s master encryption key can only be unlocked with the correct password.<\/p>\n<p>Some suppliers advertise encryption \u201cin transit\u201d and \u201cat rest\u201d, but they hold the encryption keys for both, which enables them (or any third party with access to their systems) to decrypt and manipulate your data.<\/p>","c":[2]},{"q":" I noticed that you are using HTTPS for transferring already encrypted file data. Isn't that redundant?\r","a":"<p>It is. Unfortunately, browsers take offence with establishing insecure connections from a secure page, and who could blame them for that - they can't possibly be aware of the fact that there is another encryption layer already in operation.<\/p>","c":[2]},{"q":" What encryption algorithms does MEGA use internally?\r","a":"<p>For bulk transfers, AES-128 (we believe that the higher CPU utilisation of AES-192 and AES-256 outweighs the theoretical security benefit, at least until the advent of quantum computers). Post-download integrity checking is done through a chunked variation of CCM, which is less efficient than OCB, but not encumbered by patents.<\/p>\n<p>For establishing shared secrets between users and dropping files into your inbox, RSA-2048 (the key length was chosen as middle grounds between &quot;too insecure&quot; and &quot;too slow&quot;).\nAll encryption, decryption and key generation is implemented in JavaScript, which limits AES throughput to a few megabytes per second and causes significant CPU load. We are looking forward to the availability of the HTML5 WebCrypto API in all major browsers, which will eliminate this bottleneck.<\/p>\n<p>JavaScript's weak built-in random number generator is enhanced through a mouse\/keyboard timing-driven RC4 entropy pool as well as crypto.* randomness where available.<\/p>","c":[2]},{"q":" I configured my browser to reject SSL connections without secure renegotiation, and MEGA no longer loads. Why?\r","a":"<p>For security and efficiency reasons, our SSL servers do not implement renegotiation at all. Unfortunately, your browser cannot distinguish between insecure and no renegotiation and refuses to complete the SSL connection once configured to reject insecure renegotiation. Please disable this requirement for requests to mega.nz and mega.co.nz.<\/p>","c":[2]},{"q":" How can I change my password?\r","a":"<p>Log into your account.

Therefore, it is not recommended to sync large log files or database tables. Encrypted delta writes are planned for a future release.<\/p>","c":[4]},{"q":"Are there any restrictions with regards to filenames?\r","a":"<p>On Linux, filenames are typically case sensitive, while on OS X and Windows, they generally are not. A folder containing both &quot;ABC.TXT&quot; and &quot;abc.txt&quot; can be synced to a UNIX machine without problems, but when synced to a Windows machine, only one of the two files will survive.\nMEGA imposes no restrictions on filenames - they can contain characters that are incompatible with the operating system, such as : or *. These will be rewritten as %xx on the local side and converted back to the original character when synced back. The Windows Explorer also has trouble with a number of seemingly innocuous file and folder names - &quot;con.doc&quot;, for example, would not be accessible (to understand why, you have to be a geek or a veteran, or both). If you encounter such a situation, simply rename the file on the cloud side. Foreign characters in filenames are fully supported, but invalid Unicode sequences can lead to problems.\nMEGAsync supports deep folder structures (within MEGA\u2019s cap of 63 levels) and very long pathnames (up to 32,000 characters under Windows). Unfortunately, most Windows software (including the Explorer) is unable to access files whose path is longer than 260 characters.<\/p>","c":[4]},{"q":" Can I sync FAT\/FAT32 partitions under Windows?\r","a":"<p>While it may appear to work at first glance, we strongly advise against it, because FAT timestamps are timezone dependent, resulting in all of your files being re-synced twice a year if you live in an area observing daylight saving time. Unfortunately, the following fundamental design flaw in the Windows API design makes it difficult to dynamically compensate for such changes: &quot;<em>When it becomes daylight saving time, the time retrieved by GetFileTime is off an hour, because the cache is not updated. When you restart the computer, the cached time that GetFileTime retrieves is correct.<\/em>&quot; In other words, do yourself a favour and avoid FAT.<\/p>","c":[4]},{"q":" Can I sync a VirtualBox filesystem?\r","a":"<p>Unfortunately, current versions of VirtualBox implement a filesystem that is not conforming to the minimum standards required by MEGAsync to operate reliably.<\/p>","c":[4]},{"q":" I am trying to rename a local folder in Explorer, but the name of the corresponding folder in my cloud drive stays the same, no matter what I do.\r","a":"<p>The folder you are trying to rename contains a hidden file called desktop.ini with a LocalizedResourceName= field that your renames went to - the actual folder name didn't change at all!
