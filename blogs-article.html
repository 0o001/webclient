<p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">Nine months after our launch, MEGA is born again with significant optimizations and improvements and a fresh look. This is a summary of what's new.</p><div class=\"blog-article-divider\"></div><p class=\"strong-paragraph new-blog-icon faster-loading-icon\">Faster loading</p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">We have cut down on code size and implemented dynamic feature fetching.</p><div class=\"blog-article-divider\"></div><p class=\"strong-paragraph new-blog-icon new-user-interface\">New user interface</p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">We have refreshed MEGA's look & feel. We have dramatically reduced CPU overhead, resulting in a snappier user experience - especially if you have a lot of files and large folders.</p><img alt=\"\" src=\"images/mega/blogs/filemanager_full_size.png\" class=\"blog-new-full-img middle-blog-img\"><div class=\"blog-article-divider\"></div><p class=\"strong-paragraph new-blog-icon local-caching-icon\">Local caching</p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">MEGA will cache your session in your browser, speeding up subsequent logins - only changes that have occurred since the session ended need to be loaded from the server.</p><div class=\"blog-article-divider\"></div><p class=\"strong-paragraph new-blog-icon user-avatars-icon\">User avatars</p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">You can now set up your own profile image that will appear in your friends' contact lists in real time. Simply drag and drop your picture onto your account page, then scale and crop it.</p><div class=\"blog-article-divider\"></div><p class=\"strong-paragraph new-blog-icon contact-management-icon\">Improved contact management</p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">You can now see the number of files a user is sharing with you, along with the last modified date/time. This is useful for tracking changes (in addition to the instant notifications).</p><div class=\"blog-article-divider\"></div><p class=\"strong-paragraph new-blog-icon new-tree-panel-icon\">New tree panel navigation </p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">You can now easily switch between your contacts (shared folders), your cloud drive, your rubbish bin and your inbox by using the four colour-coded buttons at the top, allowing you to navigate conveniently between these sections. You can, for example, drop a file into a contact's inbox by dragging it over the contacts icon which will automatically scroll to your contact list.</p><div class=\"blog-article-divider\"></div><p class=\"strong-paragraph new-blog-icon improved-transfers-icon\">Improved file transfers</p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">Navigating the site while file transfers are in progress is now supported. Your transfer queue will shrink to a small transfer widget in the lower left corner whenever you leave the file manager.</p><div class=\"blog-article-divider\"></div><p class=\"strong-paragraph new-blog-icon firefox-extension-icon\">Firefox extension</p><p class=\"small-pad-paragraph\">This extension will reduce loading times, improve download performance and strengthen security. Downloaded data is written directly to your hard drive instead of buffering it in the browser. It also allows you to download entire folder structures. Updates to the app are cryptographically signed - by us, not by an entity that falls under the jurisdiction of National Security Letters.</p><div class=\"blog-article-divider\"></div><p class=\"strong-paragraph new-blog-icon this-month-icon\">Expected later this month:</p><ul><li>iOS app<img alt=\"\" src=\"images/mega/blogs/iOS_fullsize.png\" class=\"blog-new-full-img list-blog-img\"></li><li>Sync client</li></ul><div class=\"blog-article-divider\"></div><p class=\"strong-paragraph new-blog-icon new-year-icon\">Expected early 2014:</p><ul><li>Encrypted messaging: write & receive messages with unlimited attachments, all encrypted.<img alt=\"\" src=\"images/mega/blogs/messages_full_size.png\" class=\"blog-new-full-img list-blog-img\"></li><li>Encrypted (video) chat: chat in real-time with your contacts and have Skype-like video chats, all encrypted in the browser.<img alt=\"\" src=\"images/mega/blogs/chat_video_full_size.png\" class=\"blog-new-full-img list-blog-img\"></li></ul>
