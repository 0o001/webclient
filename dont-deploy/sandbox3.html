         devboot is a temp solution that is used in our CI for demo purposes... (no php there ;)), so if anyone wonders
         whats the "dont-deploy" folder, it contains stuff which are used for development/debugging/internal demo
         purposes and it should not be deployed to production.

         the devboot.html also setups the localStorage so that:

         0) clear the localStorage

         1) debug mode is enabled - e.g. a lot of stuff will be printed in the dev console, via console.*

         2) static path is dynamically set to ../../ (relative to dont-deploy/devboot.html) which means that the
         staticPath should be correctly set even if you have your project running in localhost/meganz-webclient/ or
         customVhost/ + it will work with http OR https

         3) will enable the megaChat (<-- major thing, may change a lot of stuff)

         4) will force the secureboot to load the actual .js files instead of just pushing ALL javascript files into a
         single blog: (this was really helpful for me when i had to debug the js code using the Chrome debugger)

         5) will enable stopOnAssertFail, which in case of assertion fail (mainly in the chat.js code) will run a
         debugger; (something pretty handy during development)
